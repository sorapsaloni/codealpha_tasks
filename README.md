**Music Recommendation System** | Internship Project @CodeAlpha

This project mimics Spotify’s recommendation logic by predicting if a user will replay a song within a month using machine learning.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given a user's interaction history with songs, the system predicts whether a song will be replayed within 30 days (`1`) or not (`0`). This helps personalize song suggestions for better engagement.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Dataset

A mock dataset was created with features like:
- Song duration, tempo, energy
- Popularity score
- Timestamp of play
- Encoded mood and genre

---

## 🤖 ML Model

Used a **Random Forest Classifier** due to its reliability in classification problems. Achieved good accuracy after basic preprocessing and feature selection.
